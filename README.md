# Old and Random C Projects

When I started to code for real in 2009-2010 (*let's not count the alert() loops I was building in JavaScript on my family computer, all the other nonsense in batch files and the fun with Windows XP's command prompt at school at around 12*), I experimented in C with the SDL library by recreating 2D games and with a bit of cryptography.

## Projects

### Pong

The fun thing about that poor [implementation](/Pong/main.c) is the challenge added by the speed variation of the ball (from a bounce on the paddle to another).

### Snake

This one was easier to accomplish than I had anticipated back then, but I still can't stand that [code](/Snake/main.c)...

### SuperWeakCipher

Just learning about XOR and all, I decided to create myself this repeated-key XOR cipher thinking it would be unbreakable... Let's say that I'm really happy I didn't encrypt anything sensitive with [that](/SuperWeakCipher/main.c).

Look at that beauty, not even encoding binary output.
